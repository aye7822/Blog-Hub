        content: `# Mastering TypeScript: Advanced Patterns and Best Practices

TypeScript has become the go-to language for modern web development. Let's explore advanced patterns that will make you a TypeScript expert.

## Advanced Type Patterns

### 1. Conditional Types
Conditional types allow you to create types that depend on other types:

\`\`\`typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
type ApiResponse<T> = T extends string ? { message: T } : { data: T };
\`\`\`

### 2. Mapped Types
Transform existing types into new ones:

\`\`\`typescript
type Partial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];
};

type Required<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]-?: T[P];
};
\`\`\`

### 3. Template Literal Types
Create complex string literal types:

\`\`\`typescript
type EventName<T extends string> = \`on\${Capitalize<T>}\`;
type MouseEvent = EventName<'click'>; // 'onClick'
\`\`\`

## Utility Types Deep Dive

### Pick and Omit
Selectively choose or exclude properties:

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

type PublicUser = Omit<User, 'password'>;
type UserSummary = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;
\`\`\`

### Record and Partial
Create object types with specific keys:

\`\`\`typescript
type Theme = 'light' | 'dark';
type ColorScheme = Record<Theme, string>;
\`\`\`

## Advanced Generic Patterns

### Generic Constraints
Limit what types can be used with generics:

\`\`\`typescript
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function logLength<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): T {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}
\`\`\`

### Generic Defaults
Provide default types for generics:

\`\`\`typescript
interface ApiResponse<T = any> {
  data: T;
  status: number;
  message: string;
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Strict Mode
Enable strict mode for better type safety:

\`\`\`json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Prefer Interfaces for Object Shapes
Use interfaces for object types and type aliases for unions:

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

type Status = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
\`\`\`

### 3. Use Discriminated Unions
Create type-safe state machines:

\`\`\`typescript
type LoadingState = { status: 'loading' };
type SuccessState = { status: 'success'; data: any };
type ErrorState = { status: 'error'; error: string };

type AsyncState = LoadingState | SuccessState | ErrorState;
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Mastering these advanced TypeScript patterns will make your code more type-safe, maintainable, and expressive. Start with one pattern at a time and gradually incorporate them into your projects.`,
